# Football League club website
Inspired by the poor usability and accessibility of the boilerplate website used by many Football League clubs, I decided to have a go at re-building it from the ground up.

## Aims
* Re-assess information architecture and look for ways to cut down on complexity, whilst bringing important information more to the fore
* Re-build the front-end using an adaptive, "mobile first" approach
* Improve accessibility

## Existing page structure
* **Home**
* **News** (Latest news, Pre-match interviews, Post-match interviews, Your 90 minutes, Designated charity, Rams Player, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Rams Wall, YouTube, Vine, Google+)
* **Fixtures & Results** (League table, Fixtures list, Match preview, Match report, Image gallery, U21 fixtures, U18 fixtures, Match highlights, Live match commentary, The Full 90, The Ram, Download fixtures, Matchday betting)

## Existing home page features
