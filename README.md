# Football League club website
Inspired by the poor usability and accessibility of the boilerplate website used by many Football League clubs, I decided to have a go at re-building it from the ground up, whilst keep the same structure and information architecture.

## Page structure

* News
  * Latest news
  * Pre-match interviews
  * Post-match interviews
  * Your 90 minutes
  * Designated charity
  * Rams Player
