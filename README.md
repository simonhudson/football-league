# Football League club website
Inspired by the poor usability and accessibility of the boilerplate website used by many Football League clubs, I decided to have a go at re-building it from the ground up, using Derby County FC as an example.

## Aims
* Re-assess information architecture and look for ways to cut down on complexity, whilst bringing important information more to the fore
* Re-build the front-end using an adaptive, "mobile first" approach
* Improve accessibility
